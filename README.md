# NeuralNetwork To Patterns_Recognition

This is a simple trying with Neural Network to Patterns_Recognition and a kind of OpenGL to viewing the process.

"The neural approach applies biological concepts to machines to recognize patterns. The outcome of this effort is invention of artificial neural networks. A neural network is an information processing system. It consists of massive simple processing units with a high degree of interconnection between each unit"
